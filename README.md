# Annoying-cookie-consent

Learning JS concepts from this project and onwards, listing below the contents that I learnt while building this

setTimeout
preventDefault() : prevents the default behaviour of an event
FormData : use to get the data from the HTML form
formData.get() : this methos is used to access the desired data from the form
element.style : can set the style using javascript
mouseenter event : when applied to the element it detects the the cursor when hovered over
classList.toggle() : pass in the class and it will be added and removed from the element as desired
disabled attribute : used on the button in the project, disabled the button
learnt that in the HTML form all buttons are treated as type='submit' by default
